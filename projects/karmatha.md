            For my portfolio website I'm using <a href='https://jekyllrb.com/'>Jekyll</a> site generator on GitHub pages. I wanted full creative freedom without being restrained by a CMS or template. The ease of setting up and the ability of updating it through git from anywhere is a huge bonus. The site is set up fairly static, no database is needed, but uses <a href='https://shopify.github.io/liquid/'>Liquid templates</a> for dynamic aspects and to seperate content from markup.
