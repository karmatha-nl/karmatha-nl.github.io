I developed a 'human computation' game to facilitate the collection of a data corpus of humans performing various gestures. The game was created using the Unity 4.6 game engine and uses a Microsoft Kinect for Windows v2 for interaction and gesture capturing. It was tested during an experiment in 2015 with 36 voluntary participants. They each performed four gestures referring to different shapes, after which they had to validate existing gesture performances (demonstrated through a virtual agent). During the validation, participants could choose between four different shapes (one of which was the actual referent shape, i.e. ground truth) or choose "I don't know".
