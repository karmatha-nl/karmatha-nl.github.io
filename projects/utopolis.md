        Worked in a team to develop a browser based (three.js) economy / city building game for high school students. The idea was that part of the resources needed to advance in the game would be gained through getting good grades for tests in school. The game has both collective and individual incentives.
            </p>
            <p>
        Students need to decide how to build their cities, which together comprise
        a province, in order to reach a higher achievement score (of the province) than the province of a
        competing class. The setting of the game takes place in a fictional iron age style world. One region corresponds to one class and is composed of cities. The students in the class are divided among these cities based on grouping by the teacher (either random or with an express purpose). The game play revolves around building the city and province guided by completing given quests. Each city is built of structures, which can be built with [an initial stock] of resources and citizens; citizens are only received by being awarded by the teacher for desired behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
        A student can then assign citizens to build a structure (using the resources the student has).
        Structures then produce further resources (except houses, which when built produce one citizen
        – making houses the only way to increase the number of citizens a student has, other than being
        rewarded citizens by the teacher). Resources are both tangible (such as brick and wood) and
        intangible (such as knowledge).
            </p>
        I was responsible for the GUI design and implementation and a large part of the game engine code.
