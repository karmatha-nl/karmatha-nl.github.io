Prototype of Virtual Reality (VR) application which aims to make learning a language efficient and fun. The prototype presents a multi-user virtual environment where language students represented as virtual avatars, can communicate in a foreign language whilst a teacher observes, gives instructions and feedback.

Players are wearing (Google cardboard) headsets and can use the built-in microphone of their smartphone. When players are looking around their avatar's head movement and rotation is actually visible to the other player. Also, when a player talks, the other player will see the lips of his avatar move. Players are thus immersed in a realistic scenario which will likely facilitate learning and knowledge retention.
