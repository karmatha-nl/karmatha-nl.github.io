# spassvogel.github.io

This repo hosts my portfolio website. It is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator.

The choice for a static site was a logical one, I don't need a CMS and complete back-end for this project. And being hosted by GitHub means I can update it easily from anywhere. Also it allows for anyone interested to have a look at the source code.

To run locally: 
- install jekyll
- clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:spassvogel/spassvogel.github.io.git` 
- run jekyll: `$jekyll serve --watch --baseurl=''`
